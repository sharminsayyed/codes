Q.1) Consider the following database:  
   
Room (room_no, room_name, room_type, charges)   
Guest (Guest_code, Gname, city, no_of persons)   
  
The relationship is as follows: Room-Guest: one-to-one. The room_type can have values as 
either ‘AC’ or ‘NonAC’.   
    
A) Create above database in PostgreSQL and insert sufficient records.                        
Execute the following queries in PostGreSQL         
i) List all guests whose name starts with “S”.  
ii) Increase the charges of all AC rooms by 15%.   
iii) List the minimum charges of a room.   
iv) List the names of the guests in the sorted order by city name.  

B) Write a procedure to find sum and product of two numbers.     

Answe ->>>
create table room(rno int primary key , rnm varchar(20) ,rtype varchar(20) check(rtype in ('AC','NonAC')),rcharges float);
create table guest(gcode int primary key , gname varchar(20),gcity varchar(20) ,nofp int);

 rno |      rnm      | rtype | rcharges
-----+---------------+-------+----------
   1 | Ocean View    | AC    |  2300.89
   2 | Beach View    | NonAC |  3300.89
   3 | Mountain View | AC    |   300.89

 city |  gname   |  gcity   | nofp
------+----------+----------+------
    1 | sharmin  | Pune     |    3
    2 | sushmita | mumbai   |    4
    3 | laxmi    | Banglore |    5
    4 | pooja    | kolkata  |    3
    5 | shahid   | agra     |    2

i) List all guests whose name starts with “S”
--> select * from guest where gname like 's%';

ii) Increase the charges of all AC rooms by 15%.   
--> update room set rcharges  = rcharges + rcharges *0.15;

iii) List the minimum charges of a room.   
--> select min(rcharges) from room;
-->select * from room where rcharges = (select min(rcharges) from room);

iv) List the names of the guests in the sorted order by city name. 
-->select gname from guest order by gcity;
--> select * from guest order by gcity;

B) Write a procedure to find sum and product of two numbers.
-->
create or replace procedure addnumbers(a in int ,b in int , sum out int ,prod out int) as $$
begin 
sum := a+b;
prod := a*b;
end;
$$ language 'plpgsql';
